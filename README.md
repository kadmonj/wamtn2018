# Dynamics of learning and computations in neuronal circuits

#### **June 27-29, 2018 • Göttingen, Germany • Tutorials: June 26**

Please find most updated schedule [here](http://www.wamtn.info/schedule.html).



### Abstract
Understanding information processing in the brain requires powerful mathematical techniques capable of capturing the nonlinear and noisy dynamics observed across different temporal and spatial scales. At the level of local circuits, a mesoscopic computational theory for neuronal circuits typically entails two essential dynamical processes: (i) the dynamics of learning and synaptic organisation processes that follow the statistics of stimuli and tasks; and (ii) the dynamics of neuronal activity-patterns dynamics in response to a particular stimulus and internal states of the network. While these two critical processes typically operate on different timescales and have been studied separately, they are unarguably related. A common assertion is that simple and local plasticity rules may lead to complicated representations. Nonetheless, understanding the limits imposed by the computation phase, such as capacity or dynamic stability, can guide the study of relevant local rules in the learning phase.



This workshop will focus on the inherent difficulties of studying the spatiotemporal neural circuit dynamics. Of particular interest are studies that apply new or modified theoretical frameworks for studying disordered systems that yield testable predictions. This forum is intended for researchers to not only share results but also survey and discuss recent advances in methods and to pinpoint limitations of the existing theoretical tools.

We seek active discussions among participants and speakers, the exchange of new approaches and methods, and presentations that will spark new ideas for future developments. These exchanges will be complemented by poster presentations from students and postdocs. Aday of tutorial sessions will be held prior to the main meeting, covering some of the background and methods discussed in the workshop.

Attendance of the workshop is free but limited, and registration is required. Seats will be allocated on first-come-first-served basis. Accepted abstracts for poster submission will be guaranteed a seat.  **[Apply now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC3dFpjzQPS7AR9p4XXarfZcDKFhehSq-WB7JKbEXAWsaNKA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1&amp;usp=mail_form_link)**.

### Poster submission

Poster submissions are highly encouraged. Please [submit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC3dFpjzQPS7AR9p4XXarfZcDKFhehSq-WB7JKbEXAWsaNKA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1&amp;usp=mail_form_link) your abstracts before April 20, 2018. You will be informed about your registration at the end of April. Due to the limited time and a schedule that promotes exchanges of advanced research ideas, talks are by invitation only.
